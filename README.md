The store’s core sales metrics reveal a strong preference for fresh produce among customers. Bananas stand out as the most frequently purchased item and are commonly the first product added to shopping carts. This trend is mirrored in the dominance of the "fresh fruits" aisle and the broader "produce" department, which consistently generate the highest order volumes. The top-performing department-aisle combinations—such as "produce - fresh fruits," "produce - fresh vegetables," and "produce - packaged vegetables fruits"—underscore the central role of fresh and healthy food items in consumer behavior.
Customer behavior patterns provide further insight into shopping habits. Staple items like purified water, whole milk, and omega 3 milk show high reorder rates, indicating strong loyalty and recurring demand. Most orders are placed between 8 AM and 8 PM, suggesting optimal windows for promotions and delivery scheduling. Additionally, Sunday and Monday emerge as peak shopping days, likely reflecting weekly restocking routines. On average, customers place orders every 15.45 days, offering a useful benchmark for predicting future purchases and designing engagement strategies

The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis segments customers into actionable groups for targeted marketing. "Champions" are the most valuable, purchasing frequently and spending the most, while "Loyal Customers" and "Potential Loyalists" show promise for sustained engagement through personalized offers. "New Customers" require nurturing via onboarding and welcome incentives, whereas "At Risk" and "Need Attention" segments benefit from win-back campaigns and targeted promotions. "Hibernating" customers, with low scores across all metrics, may need aggressive re-engagement strategies or be deprioritized.
Inventory and profitability metrics highlight the importance of maintaining stock for high-demand items like bananas and fresh produce. Efficient supply chain management is essential to meet consistent demand and avoid stockouts. At the same time, evaluating the profitability of underperforming categories can help streamline operations and improve margins. These insights support a data-driven approach to inventory planning and category management.

Finally, basket analysis offers strategic opportunities for marketing and merchandising. Products like bananas, often added first to carts, can be used to anchor promotional bundles or drive cross-selling. In contrast, items like Orange Liqueur, typically added later, may benefit from strategic placement or targeted recommendations. Together, these insights enable smarter product positioning, personalized promotions, and optimized customer journeys throughout the shopping experience
